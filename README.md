# Image Processing System

## Overview

This project contains C++ code designed to handle 16-bit image data processing from a `txr_CBpDetectorImgBuf` object, which represents image slices captured from a detector. The code processes these images in specific ways, such as discarding certain images if they contain mostly background pixels and splitting images based on time differences between slices. The key functionalities include reading images, determining if an image should be discarded, and processing image slices.

## Features

- **Read 16-bit Image Data**: Extracts 16-bit image data from the `txr_CBpDetectorImgBuf` buffer into an OpenCV `cv::Mat` matrix for further processing.
- **Discard Unnecessary Images**: Evaluates whether an image should be discarded based on its pixel composition. If over 95% of the pixels are zero, the image is considered mostly blank and can be discarded.
- **Slice Processing**: Retains only the first 12 columns of image slices that meet the blank image criteria.
- **Time and Pixel-Based Image Splitting**: The code compares the time difference between image slices and the pixel data to decide if an image needs to be split for further processing.


## Usage

To run the code, ensure that you have OpenCV installed. You can download OpenCV from the official website, and follow the instructions to integrate it into Visual Studio Community for building and running this project.

### Steps to Set Up OpenCV

1. **Download OpenCV**: 
   Visit the [OpenCV Homepage](https://opencv.org) to download the latest version of OpenCV. You can find detailed documentation and installation guides on the website.

### OpenCV Resources:
- **Homepage**: <https://opencv.org>
- **Docs**: <https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/>
- **Q&A forum**: <https://forum.opencv.org>
- **Additional OpenCV functionality**: <https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib>

2. **Integrate with Visual Studio**: 
   After downloading OpenCV, follow the integration steps to set it up in Visual Studio. You can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/) for configuring Visual Studio to work with OpenCV libraries.
   
   Once configured, you can compile the code using Visual Studio and execute the program.
